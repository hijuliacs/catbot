<h2 align="center">Info</h2>
<p align="center">This landing page presents a fictional Discord bot I created, named Catbot. I coded it from a tutorial posted on Rafaella Ballerini's YouTube channel and made some changes so that everything wouldn't be completely the same as the proposed model. I used only HTML and CSS and finished everything in about 1 hour and a half.</p>

<h2 align="center">What I Learned</h2>
<p align="center">Due to the incredible Rafaella's didactics, it was not that hard. Because it was my first time programming, I learned a lot in practice that I already knew only in theory, the basics. I understood how the CSS Flexbox works, the HTML anatomy and the creation of divs.</p>
