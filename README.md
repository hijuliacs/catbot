<h2 align="left">📁 About the project</h2>
<p align="left">This is a landing page that presents a (fictitious) bot to be used in Discord, named by me as Catbot. I coded it from a video tutorial posted on YouTube by influencer Rafaella Ballerini and made some changes, so that everything would not be exactly the same.</p>
<br>
</br>

<h2 align="left">💻 Technologies I used</h2>
<p align="left">Everything was done only with HTML and CSS.
